# guice_testing
The first commit in this sets up a guice project that can read properties and make them available. This is comparible to the spring project that has been set up (see the spring_testing project)

Have added `WireMockServer` which seems to be similar to `UnderTow` or `Jetty` for quicky having a server up

Added `UniRest` as a mechanism for dispatching rest requests in a simple manner.
